# Ibrahim .B 💻

Hi 👋, I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for building modern, scalable, and reliable applications 🚀. I have experience working with a range of technologies, including:

### TypeScript 💎:
I use TypeScript to build robust and reliable applications, leveraging its static typing and advanced language features to write clean, maintainable code.

### Next.js 💻: 
I use Next.js to build server-rendered React applications that are fast, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### Tailwind CSS 💅:
I use Tailwind CSS to build fast, responsive, and customizable user interfaces with a minimal amount of custom CSS.

### Prisma 🔥:
I use Prisma to build powerful, flexible, and scalable APIs that integrate with a range of databases, including PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

### PostgreSQL 🗄:
I have experience working with PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable open-source relational database management system.

### MongoDB 🗂:
I have experience working with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database that is well-suited to handling large amounts of unstructured data.

In addition to these technologies, I am also familiar with a range of other tools and frameworks, including Git, Linux 🐧, and Docker 🐳. I am always looking to learn and improve my skills 📚, and I am excited to take on new challenges and opportunities 💪.

You can find some of my work on GitHub 💻, and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project 🤝.
